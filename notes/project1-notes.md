# SQL and NoSQL databases

#### SQL (SQLite):

- Data Model: Relational. Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and relationships are defined between tables using foreign keys.
- Schema: Strict. Requires a predefined schema, meaning you must define the structure of your data (columns, data types) before storing it.
- Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language).

` Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite. `
```
CREATE TABLE Users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER
);

```
- Use Cases: Applications requiring data integrity, complex relationships, and ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) 

#### NoSQL (MongoDB):

- Data Model: Document-oriented. Data is stored in JSON-like documents within collections.
- Schema: Flexible (schema-less). Documents in a collection can have different structures.
- Query Language: MongoDB Query Language (based on JavaScript).

` Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra `
``` 
Each document is a JSON-like object

{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25
}

```
- Use Cases: Applications with rapidly changing data structures, high read/write loads, and the need for horizontal scalability, such as social media platforms, content management systems, or IoT applications.

# Prisma
Prisma is a modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Node.js and TypeScript.
- It acts like a bridge between our code and our database, making it easier to read/write data. That means it simplifies database interaction.


#### Without Prisma, we have to:

- Write raw SQL queries manually
- Handle database connections yourself
- Deal with inconsistent data manually

#### With Prisma, we can: 
- Use JavaScript/TypeScript code to interact with our database
- ensure type safety, autocompletion, and easy migrations

### Working with prisma 

Before starting working with prisma, I installed Prisma CLI and Client

``` 
npm install prisma --save-dev 

npm install @prisma/client 
```

I added the Prisma CLI as a dev dependency (--save-dev) because itâ€™s only needed during development and build time, not in the production environment. The @prisma/client package is a runtime dependency used by the application to query the database.



1.   I defined schema/ database structure in a ` schema.prisma ` file. 

for example:
```
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
}
```


2. I configured the database connection by setting the DATABASE_URL in the .env file, telling Prisma where my database is located.

3. I ran Prisma migrations to create the database and tables based on the schema:
`npx prisma migrate dev`
then named migration


### How it simplified my work
- I only needed to define my data models once in the schema.prisma file. Prisma took care of translating that into database tables.
- Instead of writing SQL migration scripts manually, Prisma generates and applies them automatically, saving time and reducing errors.


## Revison

### Routing

Routing defines how your application responds to different URLs and HTTP methods.It directs incoming requests to the right code.

 ```
 // Respond to GET requests at /users

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Retrieve all users')
})

// Respond to POST requests at /users

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Create a new user')
})
 ```

### ORM 
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) lets you interact with your database using familiar programming objects instead of raw SQL.

```
// Create a new user

const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Laxmi',
    email: 'laxmi@example.com',
  },
})

// Fetch all users
const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
```
 Prisma automatically translates these commands into efficient SQL queries.

 ### Middleware 
 Is software that sits between a request and a response, performing tasks like logging, authentication, or modifying requests.

 ```
 app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Incoming request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`)
  next() // Pass control to the next handler
})

 ```
### JSON APIs 
JSON APIs send and receive data in JSON format, which is widely supported and easy to use.
```
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
  res.json(users)
})
// this endpoint returns a JSON array of users
```

### Git basics
Git tracks changes to your code, enabling collaboration and version control.
```
git init                 // Start a new Git repository
git add .                // Stage changes for commit
git commit -m "meaningful message"  //Save changes with a descriptive message
git push origin main     // Upload your changes to GitHub
```


## During migration

### What is a migration?

A migration is a change to the database schema. It's a way to update the structure of the database to keep it up-to-date with the application's needs.

### Why do we need migrations?

When we add new features or make changes to the database schema, we need to update the database to keep it in sync with the application. This is called a migration.

### How do we create a migration?

We use the Prisma CLI to create a migration. The CLI will generate a new migration file based on the changes we want to make to the database.

To create a migration, we run the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This command will generate a new migration file in the `migrations` directory. The file will have a timestamp in its name, indicating when it was created.

This command will apply the migration to the database and update the database schema accordingly.

### How do we rollback a migration?

If we make a mistake during the migration process, we can roll back to the previous version of the database. We can do this by running the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate reset
```

This command will roll back the migration to the previous version of the database.

## Switching databases

Prisma supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and more. To switch databases, we need to update the `schema.prisma` file and set the `provider` property to the desired database.

For example, to switch to MongoDB, we would update the `schema.prisma` file to look like this:

```
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

And then set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the MongoDB connection string.

then we have to run the following command:

``` 
npx prisma db push
```
